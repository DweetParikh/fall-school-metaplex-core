# Solana Fall School: Metaplex Core

Hands-on workshop for [Metaplex Core](https://www.metaplex.com/docs/smart-contracts/core), Solana's next-gen NFT standard. A laptop and Node.js are all you need.

## The tracks

Tracks (1) and (2) build the same thing: a **soulbound (non-transferable) NFT** on devnet, permanently bound to your wallet. For a deeper understanding of how soulbound assets work in Core, see the official guide: [Soulbound Assets in MPL Core](https://www.metaplex.com/docs/smart-contracts/core/guides/create-soulbound-nft-asset).

### (1) Easy track: TypeScript / Umi

No Rust, no Solana CLI. Run `npm install` once at the repo root, complete the TODOs in `scripts/2-mint-soulbound.ts` and mint on devnet.

**→ Start with [01-easy-track/README.md](./01-easy-track/README.md)**

**Submit:** your asset's explorer link, `https://explorer.solana.com/address/BKGi4D1wJHRETL2Aus5pEqyraZPsK7Z4qWFdAdwFY6x4?cluster=devnet`

### (2) Anchor track: Rust on-chain program

The same soulbound mint, but as an Anchor program that CPIs into MPL Core: you complete the TODOs in the program's handler. Requires the Rust + Solana + Anchor toolchain.

**→ Start with [02-anchor-track/README.md](./02-anchor-track/README.md)**

**Submit:** a PR adding `02-anchor-track/submissions/<your-github-handle>/` with your client mint script and a filled-in `SUBMISSION.md` (program ID + asset explorer links).

## How the soulbound part works

The asset is created with the **`PermanentFreezeDelegate`** plugin:

- `frozen: true`: frozen from birth; MPL Core itself rejects every transfer or burn attempt.
- `authority: { type: "None" }`: nobody can ever update the plugin, so it can never be thawed. Bound to its owner's wallet forever.

## Bonus challenge: Print Editions with different royalties

Based on [Print Editions with MPL Core](https://www.metaplex.com/docs/smart-contracts/core/guides/print-editions): create a Master Edition collection, print 3 numbered Editions into it, and give each edition a different royalty via an asset-level `Royalties` plugin.

**→ Start with [03-bonus-editions/README.md](./03-bonus-editions/README.md)**

**Submit:** a PR adding `03-bonus-editions/submissions/<your-github-handle>/` with your `editions.ts` and a filled-in `SUBMISSION.md` (4 explorer links: collection + 3 editions).
